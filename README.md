## About

**Forty2** is a lightweight and versatile **Java** library designed to generate
unique identifiers with customizable length and character sets.
Originally based on the concept of [Nano ID](https://github.com/ai/nanoid),
it provides a simple yet powerful solution for generating unique identifiers
tailored to your specific needs.

### Features

- **Customizable**: Generate identifiers of any desired length and from a wide
  range of characters, providing flexibility and adaptability to diverse
  requirements.
- **Universal Uniqueness**: Utilizes algorithms to ensure uniqueness across
  generated identifiers, guaranteeing minimal collision probability.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup and easy integration into your projects,
  facilitating smooth adoption and usage.

### üìù Note

If you came here by accident and are **looking for a more efficient** way to
generate unique identifiers than the natively built-in solution of
``java.util.UUID``, please see
[this repository](https://github.com/f4b6a3/tsid-creator).

## Installation

Below are the instructions for installing **Forty2** using
[Gradle](https://gradle.org) with [JitPack](https://jitpack.io):

### Gradle

1. Open your `build.gradle` file.
2. Add the [JitPack](https://jitpack.io) repository to your `repositories`
   block:

```groovy
repositories {
  maven {
    url = "https://jitpack.io"
    content {
      includeGroup("com.github.kvdpxne")
    }
  }
}
```

3. Add the **Forty2** dependency to your `dependencies` section:

```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation("com.github.kvdpxne:forty2:<VERSION>")
}
```

4. Replace `<VERSION>` with the version of **Forty2** you want to use.

Now, your project will fetch the **Forty2** dependency from
[JitPack](https://jitpack.io) while excluding other repositories from the
dependency search.

For more information about [JitPack](https://jitpack.io) and how it works,
you can refer to the [JitPack documentation](https://docs.jitpack.io).

## Usage

Using **Forty2** is straightforward.
After including it in your project's dependencies, you can start generating
unique identifiers with ease.

### Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to generate an identifier with **Forty2**:

```java
// Generate a 14-character identifier using alphanumeric characters.
var alphanumeric = Forty2.alphanumeric();

// Generate a 14-character identifier using all writable ASCII characters.
var all = Forty2.all();
```

Using this method ensures optimized performance and safety in generating
identifiers.

### Advanced Usage

You can customize the length and character set of the generated identifier
according to your specific requirements:

```java
// Generate a 21-character identifier using alphanumeric characters.
var alphanumeric = Forty2.alphanumeric(21);

// Generate a 21-character identifier using all writable ASCII characters.
var all = Forty2.all(21);

// Generate a 36-character identifier using specified characters.
var customized = Forty2.create("0123456789abcdef", 36);
```

### üìù Note

For security and performance reasons, it is recommended to review the character
set used for generating identifiers and ensure that it meets your application's
requirements.
Additionally, consider implementing additional security measures if identifiers
are used for sensitive operations.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

Using the method with `_` prefix like `_create` is faster than the
method without `_` prefix, but it does not perform parameter validation.
Therefore, it should only be used if you are certain about the transmitted
parameters.

Now, you can integrate **Forty2** into your Java projects and leverage its
capabilities to generate unique identifiers efficiently.
